IAI 2.0.0

A project in AI. Help an agent learn the best strategies as they face an
endless gauntlet of foes! The IAI agent moves through a world, learning and 
shopping on their own, while allowing the player to nudge them toward certain
behaviors.

# DEPENDENCIES:
python 2.7
PIL
Tkinter

# DEVELOPMENT NOTES #

Currently building a framework for the 2.0 system. Have created a functional
Map Editor, which uses a background image and time dimensions to create a file
for the game.

The game itself will involve importing elements from the original IAI, as well
as redesigning other components. Which will be added as the rest of the project
takes shape.
